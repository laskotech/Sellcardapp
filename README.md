# Sell Card â€” Complete Flutter Project (User-only test)

This project is a ready-to-build Flutter app set up for your Firebase project `my-awesome-app-c974b`.
Before building, ensure your `android/app/src/main/google-services.json` contains your Firebase config (it is already placed if you uploaded it earlier).

How to build:
1. Install Flutter (3.22+ recommended) & Android SDK.
2. Open a terminal in this folder.
3. Run:
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --release
4. The APK will be at: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

Notes:
- This is the user-only test version (OTP login, Upload Card, My Cards).
- Admin panel will be added in the next release.
